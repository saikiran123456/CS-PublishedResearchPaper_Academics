# MyResearchPaper Publication
Back in 2019 I started got interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and I have done the project during my Computer Engineering Graduation (B-Tech First Class Hons). 
I along with my team of 3 people came up with a Finteh Problem or any Government Organizations/Institutes facing Problems.

The main aim of this project is to present the efficient and robust framework for detection as well as 
recognition of logo images.

Public organizations, institutes, companies and private sectors are generally interested in 
implementing digital mail rooms to improve the efficiency of paper-intensive workflows and to reduce 
the burden of manual processing of different administrative documents including incoming mails, faxes, 
forms, invoices, reports, employee records, health record, etc. Logo can be considered as an important 
and popular salient entities presented in administrative documents. The manual 
identification/verification of logos is not an easy task, as the documents in-flow in organizations is 
growing rapidly.
